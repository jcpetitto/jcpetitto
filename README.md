### A little about the owner of these repositories...

I am a bioinformatician with an eclectic background. My academic journey included mathematics, philosophy, biology, teaching, veterinary medicine and public health, all of which have lent to a solid foundation for bioinformatics and computational biology (and a few diplomas: PhD, MPH, MAT).

My research is grounded in the principles of **Open Science**, with a strong emphasis on producing computationally **reproducible** results and **reusable**, open-source code. Experience working with a broad range of data types has lead me to a pragmatic, "right tool for the job" approach. For ***data analysis*** and ***visualization*** ***R*** is my "go-to", while I leverage the power of the tensor via ***Python*** for specialized tasks such as building ***machine learning*** pipelines. Leveraging the "multilingual" modalities of ***Quarto*** and ***Shiny***, I create ***dynamic presentations*** and ***exploratorytools*** that can be used to communicate findings.

In parallel with the "right tool for the job" mentality flows an undercurrent of "right data for the question". The background in experimental design and methodologies provided by concentrating my MPH on ***biostatistics*** and ***epidemiology*** adds to the "particular set of skills" I bring to aligning data with the research question at hand. Collectively, these elements are supported by my passion for ***data visualization*** and ***science communication*** and fueled by an intense curiosity.

### What is in these repositories?

Within these repositories, you will find projects I have worked on: course projects, thesis work, and the current projects I am able to post.
In addition to those projects, there is also the [CubEd project](https://grunwald-lab-umass.github.io/CubEd/) worked on with "my" lab, the [Grunwald Lab](https://www.umassmed.edu/grunwaldlab/), at UMass Chan Medical School. I created the GitHub page for the site using Quarto, with visual elements drawn from the Classroom Manual and Assembly Guide, which were written in collaboration with [Colton Hormann](https://github.com/SiberFreak). Colton Hormann was responsible for all of the 3D graphics and rendering. I created the layout for the pdf versions using Adobe InDesign and created the graphic elements using Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator.

Currently, I am working on an ***pipeline for processing and analyzing single-molecule tracking data*** applying *neural networks* and *likelihood estimation* to segmentation and particle tracking, which we are using to study mRNA transport through the nuclear pore complex in yeast.

I also have experience with ***NGS data*** such as bulk RNA-seq, Hi-C, and DamID data on their own as well as in combination ("*multi-omics*") and in conjunction with datasets drawn from databases such as OpenTargets.

My work has been done locally, on both Windows and Mac, as well as on ***high-performance computing clusters*** using ***command-line*** tools.

My graduate-level coursework included applying machine-learning techniques to ***LIDAR*** and ***fNIRs*** datasets as well as ***modeling protein-ligand interactions*** with tools such as ***Chimera*** and ***Rosetta***.

My experience also includes work in public health as a data scientist with the MDPH where I studied:

-   Immunization rates among young children using Massachusetts Immunization Information System (MIIS) ***EHR data*** using ***SAS***

-   Lyme disease surveillance in an endemic state using Massachusetts Virtual Epidemiologic Network (MAVEN) ***laboratory and case data*** using ***SAS*** and *R*

-   ***Policy*** and regulations applied to traveling animal exhibits such as those found at fairgrounds and brought to schools for educational purposes to make recommendations considering the potential of such activities as potential sources of disease.
