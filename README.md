**What is in these repositories?**

Within these repositories, you will find projects I have worked on: course projects, thesis work, and the current projects I am able to post..\
Aggregating my projects here and organizing the appropriate documentation is a work in progress.

**A little about the owner of these repositories...**

I am a bioinformatician with an eclectic background. My academic journey included mathematics, philosophy, biology, teaching, veterinary medicine, and public health, all of which have lent to a solid foundation for bioinformatics and computational biology.

My research is grounded in the principles of **Open Science**, with a strong emphasis on producing computationally **reproducible** results and **reusable**, open-source code. Experience working with a broad range of data types has lead me to a pragmatic, "right tool for the job" approach. For [data analysis]{.underline} and [visualization]{.underline} *R* is my "go-to", while I leverage the power of the tensor via *Python* for specialized tasks such as building [machine learning]{.underline} pipelines. Leveraging the "multilingual" modalities of *Quarto* and *Shiny*, I create [dynamic presentations]{.underline} and [exploratory tools]{.underline} that can be used to communicate findings.

Currently, I am working on an [pipeline for processing and analyzing single-molecule tracking data]{.underline} as applied to mRNA transport through the nuclear pore complex in yeast.

I also have experience with [NGS data]{.underline} such as bulk RNA-seq, Hi-C, and DamID data on their own as well as in combination ("[multi-omics"]{.underline}) and in conjunction with datasets drawn from databases such as OpenTargets

My experience also includes work in public health as a data scientist with the MDPH where I studied:

-   Immunization rates among young children using Massachusetts Immunization Information System (MIIS) [EHR data]{.underline} using *SAS*

-   Lyme disease surveillance in an endemic state using Massachusetts Virtual Epidemiologic Network (MAVEN) [laboratory and case data]{.underline} using *SAS* and *R*

-   [Policy]{.underline} and regulations applied to traveling animal exhibits such as those found at fairgrounds and brought to schools for educational purposes to make recommendations considering the potential of such activities as potential sources of disease.
